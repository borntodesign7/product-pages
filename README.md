#Responsive website templates for landing and product pages.

Those templates were created as a part of [Small Product Lab](https://gumroad.com/smallproductlab) challenge.
I created them in few days to prove myself that it's possible to build and launch something in very short period of time.
Moreover i wanted to learn how to build some frontend stuff.

If you are building your own products, you've probably heard how important landing and product pages are.
You've probably heard, that the first thing you should do is creating a landing page. You may ask why.
The answer is simple: you will commit yourself to create something and achieve your goal on time.
Moreover it's one of the best ways to build your audience.

Product page was designed following tips described by Gumroad in one of their posts:
[Anatomy of an Effective Product Page](https://gumroad.com/resource-center/anatomy-of-an-effective-product-page).
Moreover my template supports tiered pricing, which according to Gumroad's
[talk on Microconf](http://www.phraseexpander.com/blog/ryan-delk-data-behind-successful-product-launches-microconf-2014/),
can earn you more revenue.

Repo includes:

- landing page template - HTML and CSS files (demo [here](http://coming.pontait.com))
